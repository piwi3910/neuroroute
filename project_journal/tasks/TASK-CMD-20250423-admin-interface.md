# Task Log: Admin Interface for API Keys and Model Configurations

**Goal:** Implement secure admin API endpoints for managing API keys and model configurations in the NeuroRoute API.

## Current Status
- Admin routes exist but lack complete implementation for API key and model configuration management
- Limited validation and security for admin operations
- No audit logging for sensitive operations

## Required Changes
1. Enhance admin API endpoints:
   - Complete implementation of API key management endpoints (create, read, update, delete)
   - Add endpoints for model configuration management
   - Implement validation for all admin operations
   - Add pagination, filtering, and sorting for list operations
   - Implement proper error handling and response formatting

2. Implement security measures:
   - Enhance authentication and authorization for admin routes
   - Implement role-based access control for different admin operations
   - Add rate limiting for admin endpoints
   - Implement audit logging for all sensitive operations
   - Add CSRF protection for admin operations

3. Implement audit and compliance features:
   - Add detailed audit logs for all admin operations
   - Implement export functionality for logs and configurations
   - Add scheduled backup of configurations
   - Implement compliance reporting for API key usage
   - Add alerts for suspicious activities

## Acceptance Criteria
- Admin API endpoints are fully implemented and secured
- All admin operations are properly validated, authorized, and logged
- Security measures prevent unauthorized access and abuse
- Audit logs provide complete visibility into all administrative actions
