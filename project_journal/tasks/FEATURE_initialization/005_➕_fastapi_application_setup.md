# Ensure Proper FastAPI Application Setup

## Description

Verify and ensure that the FastAPI application is properly set up to handle the routing of LLM requests and provide the necessary API endpoints.

## Tasks

- [x] Review FastAPI application initialization in main.py
- [x] Check API endpoint definitions and routes
- [x] Verify request and response models
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and exception management
- [x] Check middleware configuration if applicable
- [x] Verify CORS settings if needed
- [x] Test API endpoints using test_client.py
- [x] Ensure proper documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [x] Verify logging integration with FastAPI

## Acceptance Criteria âœ…

- FastAPI application properly initialized and configured
- All required API endpoints defined and functional
- Request and response models properly defined
- Error handling and exception management in place
- API documentation available and accurate
- Successful test of API endpoints
- Proper logging of API requests and responses

## Implementation Notes

After a thorough review of the FastAPI application setup, I've verified that the application is properly configured to handle LLM request routing. Here are the detailed findings:

### 1. FastAPI Application Initialization

The FastAPI application is properly initialized in `main.py` with:
- Appropriate title, description, and version information
- Lifespan context manager for startup/shutdown events
- Proper documentation URLs for Swagger UI and ReDoc
- Initialization of app.start_time for uptime tracking

```python
app = FastAPI(
    title="NeuroRoute",
    description="Intelligent LLM Router API that forwards prompts to the best-suited LLM backend based on intent, complexity, and required features",
    version=get_settings().app_version,
    lifespan=lifespan,
    docs_url="/docs",
    redoc_url="/redoc",
)
```

The lifespan context manager handles:
- Logging application startup
- Creating necessary directories
- Initializing the router and checking model health
- Proper resource cleanup during shutdown

### 2. API Endpoint Definitions and Routes

The application has well-organized API routes using FastAPI's `APIRouter` for logical grouping:
- `main_router`: Core endpoints for prompt processing
- `model_router`: Endpoints for model information and capabilities
- `admin_router`: Administrative endpoints for cache management

Key endpoints include:
- `/prompt`: Main endpoint for processing prompts and routing to appropriate LLM
- `/test-model/{model_key}`: Endpoint for testing specific models directly
- `/health`: Health check endpoint for monitoring system status
- `/models/`: Endpoint for listing available models and their capabilities
- `/models/capabilities`: Endpoint for detailed capability information
- `/models/{model_key}/health`: Endpoint for checking specific model health
- `/admin/cache/clear`: Administrative endpoint for clearing the cache

All routers are properly registered with the main application.

### 3. Request and Response Models

The application uses Pydantic models for request/response validation and serialization:
- `PromptRequest`: Validates incoming prompt requests with proper field validation
- `PromptResponse`: Structures responses with model information, latency, and token usage
- `Metadata`: Handles optional request parameters like priority, model selection, and timeouts
- `TokenUsage`: Tracks token consumption for billing and monitoring
- `ModelInfo`, `ModelHealth`, `ModelMetrics`: Provide structured information about models
- `HealthCheck`: Standardizes health check responses
- `ErrorResponse`: Provides consistent error response structure

All models use appropriate field types, validation rules, and documentation.

### 4. Error Handling and Exception Management

The application implements comprehensive error handling:
- Global exception handler for catching unhandled exceptions
- Custom HTTP exception handler for standardized error responses
- Specific exception handlers for router-specific errors:
  - `ModelNotAvailableError`: When requested models are unavailable
  - `AllModelsFailedError`: When all models fail to generate a response
- Request ID tracking in all error responses for traceability
- Proper error logging with context information
- Standardized error response format with timestamps and error codes

### 5. Middleware Configuration

The application uses multiple middleware components:
- CORS middleware for handling cross-origin requests:
  ```python
  app.add_middleware(
      CORSMiddleware,
      allow_origins=get_settings().cors_origins,
      allow_credentials=True,
      allow_methods=["*"],
      allow_headers=["*"],
  )
  ```
- GZip middleware for response compression:
  ```python
  app.add_middleware(GZipMiddleware, minimum_size=1000)  # Compress responses larger than 1KB
  ```
- Custom request ID middleware for request tracking:
  ```python
  @app.middleware("http")
  async def add_request_id_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
      # Implementation details...
  ```

### 6. CORS Settings

CORS settings are properly configured to allow cross-origin requests:
- Origins are configurable via settings (`get_settings().cors_origins`)
- Credentials are allowed for authenticated requests
- All methods and headers are permitted for flexibility

### 7. API Testing

The application includes testing capabilities:
- `test_client.py` provides a CLI tool for manual API testing
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/test_api.py` verify endpoint functionality
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/test_router.py` test the router component
- The FastAPI `TestClient` is properly used for testing endpoints

Some test implementations are currently placeholders and should be completed in future tasks.

### 8. API Documentation

The application leverages FastAPI's automatic documentation generation:
- Swagger UI available at `/docs`
- ReDoc available at `/redoc`
- All endpoints have descriptive docstrings
- Request/response models include field descriptions
- Parameters are documented with type information and constraints

### 9. Logging Integration

Logging is properly integrated with the FastAPI application:
- Loguru is used for structured logging
- Request IDs are included in log messages for traceability
- Prompt data is logged to separate files for analysis
- Error logging includes context information
- Log rotation and retention are configured

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

While the FastAPI application is well-configured, some improvements could be made:

1. **Complete Test Implementation**: Implement the placeholder tests in `tests/integration/test_api.py` and `tests/unit/test_router.py`.

2. **API Versioning**: Consider implementing API versioning (e.g., `/v1/prompt`) for future compatibility.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting middleware to protect against abuse.

4. **Authentication**: Implement authentication for sensitive endpoints, especially admin routes.

5. **Metrics Collection**: Add Prometheus metrics for monitoring API performance.

6. **OpenAPI Customization**: Further customize the OpenAPI schema for better documentation.

7. **Response Caching**: Implement HTTP-level caching headers for appropriate endpoints.

8. **Async Database Integration**: If database integration is planned, ensure it uses async drivers.

These improvements can be addressed in future tasks as the project evolves.
