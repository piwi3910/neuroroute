# NeuroRoute Initialization Overview

This feature covers the initialization and setup of the NeuroRoute project - an intelligent LLM router API that forwards prompts to the best-suited LLM backend based on intent, complexity, and required features.

## Key Components

- API Endpoint: POST /prompt that routes requests to the appropriate LLM backend
- Three LLM backends: Local LM Studio, OpenAI GPT-4, and Anthropic Claude
- Core routing logic using rule-based classification
- Logging capabilities for prompts, responses, and metrics
- Optional Redis caching

## Tasks

1. Review existing codebase structure
2. Identify missing configuration or initialization steps
3. Install environment dependencies
4. Set up necessary directories or files
5. Ensure proper FastAPI application setup
6. Commit changes to Git

## Status

Feature initialization completed successfully. All tasks have been completed:

1. ✅ Review existing codebase structure - Comprehensive architecture overview created
2. ✅ Identify missing configuration or initialization steps - 8 key areas identified with recommendations
3. ✅ Install environment dependencies - All dependencies installed and verified
4. ✅ Set up necessary directories or files - Directory structure created and files added
5. ✅ Ensure proper FastAPI application setup - FastAPI application configured and tested
6. ✅ Commit changes to Git - Changes committed with security recommendations

## Known Issues

- API keys were exposed in the Git commit history. These need to be rotated and the Git history cleaned as recommended in the INIT_006 task.

## Next Steps

- Rotate the exposed API keys
- Clean the Git history using git-filter-repo
- Implement security improvements to prevent future API key exposure
- Continue with feature development based on the established architecture
