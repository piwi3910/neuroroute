# NeuroRoute Initialization Overview

This feature covers the initialization and setup of the NeuroRoute project - an intelligent LLM router API that forwards prompts to the best-suited LLM backend based on intent, complexity, and required features.

## Key Components

- API Endpoint: POST /prompt that routes requests to the appropriate LLM backend
- Three LLM backends: Local LM Studio, OpenAI GPT-4, and Anthropic Claude
- Core routing logic using rule-based classification
- Logging capabilities for prompts, responses, and metrics
- Optional Redis caching

## Tasks

1. Review existing codebase structure
2. Identify missing configuration or initialization steps
3. Install environment dependencies
4. Set up necessary directories or files
5. Ensure proper FastAPI application setup
6. Commit changes to Git

## Status

Feature initialization in progress.
