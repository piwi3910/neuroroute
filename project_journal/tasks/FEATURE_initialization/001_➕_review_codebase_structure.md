# Review Existing Codebase Structure

## Description

Perform a comprehensive review of the existing NeuroRoute codebase structure to understand the current implementation and verify all required components are properly set up.

## Tasks

- [x] Review the main application file (main.py)
- [x] Examine the router implementation (router.py)
- [x] Check the model adapters (models/*.py)
- [x] Review the classifier logic (classifier.py)
- [x] Examine the caching mechanism (cache.py)
- [x] Check the configuration setup (config.py)
- [x] Review logging utilities (utils/logger.py)
- [x] Examine the test client (test_client.py)
- [x] Document the overall architecture and component relationships

## Architecture Overview

The NeuroRoute system is designed as a FastAPI application that intelligently routes prompts to the most appropriate LLM backend based on prompt content, intent, and metadata. The system consists of the following key components:

### Core Components

1. **Main Application (main.py)**
   - FastAPI application setup with middleware, routes, and error handlers
   - Defines request/response models and API endpoints
   - Implements lifespan context manager for startup/shutdown events
   - Handles request ID tracking and error handling

2. **Router (router.py)**
   - Core routing logic that selects the appropriate model for a prompt
   - Manages model adapters and their lifecycle
   - Implements fallback mechanisms when primary models fail
   - Handles health checks and metrics collection
   - Supports both direct model selection and capability-based routing

3. **Model Adapters (models/*.py)**
   - Base adapter interface (models/base_adapter.py) defining common functionality
   - Specific adapters for different LLM providers:
     - OpenAI adapter (models/openai_adapter.py)
     - Anthropic adapter (models/anthropic_adapter.py)
     - Local LM Studio adapter (models/local_lmstudio_adapter.py)
   - Each adapter handles provider-specific API calls, error handling, and response formatting

4. **Classifier (classifier.py)**
   - Analyzes prompts to determine the most appropriate model
   - Uses keyword matching, feature extraction, and heuristics
   - Considers prompt complexity, intent, and required capabilities
   - Supports metadata-based overrides and caching of classifications

5. **Cache (cache.py)**
   - Redis-based caching system for model responses
   - Supports TTL-based expiration and metadata-sensitive caching
   - Handles connection management and error recovery
   - Provides statistics and cache clearing functionality

6. **Configuration (config.py)**
   - Pydantic-based settings management with environment variable support
   - Defines model registry with capabilities and priorities
   - Organizes settings into logical groups (API, Redis, logging, etc.)
   - Provides factory functions for component initialization

7. **Logging (utils/logger.py)**
   - Configures Loguru for structured logging
   - Supports both console and file logging
   - Provides JSON logging for prompt data and responses

8. **Test Client (test_client.py)**
   - Simple CLI tool for testing the API
   - Supports sending prompts with various metadata options
   - Displays formatted responses and performance metrics

### Component Relationships

- The **main application** initializes the router, classifier, and cache components
- The **router** uses the classifier to determine which model to use for a prompt
- The **router** manages model adapters and delegates prompt handling to them
- The **cache** is used by the router to store and retrieve model responses
- All components use the **configuration** system for settings
- All components use the **logging** system for logging events and errors

### Data Flow

1. User sends a prompt to the API
2. The router uses the classifier to analyze the prompt
3. The classifier determines the most appropriate model
4. The router checks the cache for a cached response
5. If no cache hit, the router forwards the prompt to the selected model adapter
6. The model adapter calls the LLM API and returns the response
7. The router caches the response and returns it to the user

## Acceptance Criteria âœ…

- [x] Complete understanding of the current codebase structure
- [x] Documentation of all existing components and their relationships
- [x] Identification of any architectural gaps or inconsistencies
- [x] Clear overview of how the components interact with each other
