# Install Environment Dependencies

## Description

Ensure all required dependencies from requirements.txt are installed and properly configured for the NeuroRoute project.

## Tasks

- [x] Review requirements.txt for completeness
- [x] Check for any missing dependencies not listed in requirements.txt
- [x] Install all dependencies using pip
- [x] Verify installation of all dependencies
- [x] Check for any version conflicts
- [x] Document any additional dependencies that might be needed
- [x] Set up a virtual environment if not already present

## Acceptance Criteria âœ…

- All dependencies successfully installed
- No missing dependencies for any project functionality
- No version conflicts between dependencies
- Virtual environment properly configured
- Documentation of any additional dependencies not in requirements.txt

## Notes

### Installation Process

1. Verified that a virtual environment was already set up in the `.venv` directory
2. Activated the virtual environment using `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Installed all dependencies from requirements.txt using pip
4. Encountered an issue with building the wheel for pydantic-core with Python 3.13.3
5. Successfully installed all dependencies by using a pre-compiled version of pydantic (2.11.3) and pydantic-core (2.33.1)

### Dependencies Review

All required dependencies from requirements.txt have been successfully installed:
- fastapi==0.109.1: Web framework for building APIs
- uvicorn==0.27.0: ASGI server for running FastAPI applications
- python-dotenv==1.0.0: For loading environment variables from .env files
- httpx==0.25.2: HTTP client for making API requests
- openai==1.12.0: Client for OpenAI API
- anthropic==0.8.1: Client for Anthropic API
- redis==5.0.1: For caching functionality
- loguru==0.7.2: For advanced logging
- pydantic==2.5.2 (installed 2.11.3): For data validation and settings management

No additional dependencies were identified as necessary beyond what's listed in requirements.txt. The current set of dependencies covers all the functionality needed for the NeuroRoute project based on the codebase review.
