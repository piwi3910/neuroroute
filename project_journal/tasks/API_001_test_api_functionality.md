# Task Log: API_001 - Test and Verify API Functionality

**Goal:** Test and verify the functionality of the NeuroRoute LLM Router API, including running the application, testing the /prompt endpoint, verifying responses, testing caching, and checking logging.

**Status:** âœ… Completed

**Summary of Work:**
The NeuroRoute API application has been successfully started and its core functionality verified. The following steps were completed:

1.  **Application Startup:** Resolved multiple blocking issues that prevented the application from starting cleanly.
2.  **Prompt Routing:** Tested the POST `/prompt` endpoint with simple, analysis, and long/complex prompts. Verified that prompts are correctly routed to the Local LM Studio, OpenAI, and Anthropic models based on the classification logic.
3.  **Response Verification:** Verified that responses include the correct `model_used`, a valid `response` from the LLM, and `latency_ms` information.
4.  **Caching Functionality:** Tested caching by sending a repeated prompt. Verified that the response was served from the Redis cache (`"from_cache": true`) with low latency.
5.  **Logging:** Confirmed that console logging is working and log files are being created in the `logs` directory.

**Issues Encountered and Resolved:**
-   **Pydantic Validation Errors:** Initially blocked by persistent `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError` and `pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError` related to parsing `cors_origins` and `redis.ttl` from environment variables. This was eventually resolved by refactoring the settings loading and addressing comments in the `.env` file.
-   **`AttributeError: 'ModelRouter' object has no attribute 'health_check_interval'`:** Resolved an `AttributeError` during adapter initialization by correcting the reference to `health_check_interval` in the `ModelRouter` class.
-   **`TypeError: ModelRouter._camel_to_snake() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`:** Resolved a `TypeError` related to the `_camel_to_snake` method by adding the `@staticmethod` decorator.
-   **Anthropic API Error:** Resolved an `'AsyncAnthropic' object has no attribute 'messages'` error by upgrading the `anthropic` client library.
-   **Dynamic Adapter Loading Warnings:** Investigated warnings about not being able to dynamically load adapters. While the adapters are initialized via a fallback, the warnings were due to incorrect capitalization in the `adapter_class` name in `config.py` and issues with the `_camel_to_snake` function's handling of capitalization. Fixes were implemented in `config.py` and `router.py`.

**Potential Improvements:**
-   Although the dynamic adapter loading warnings are resolved in terms of functionality, they still appear during startup. Further refinement of the dynamic loading logic or the `_camel_to_snake` function could lead to a completely clean startup output.

**Conclusion:** The core functionality of the NeuroRoute LLM Router API, including routing, caching, and logging, has been successfully tested and verified after resolving several startup and runtime errors. The application is now functional and ready for further development or deployment.
