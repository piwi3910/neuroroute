# Task Log: TASK-CMD-20250423-testing-validation

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive testing and validation framework for the NeuroRoute API to ensure reliability, correctness, and performance.

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified the following components that need testing:

1. **Model Adapters**:
   - OpenAI Adapter
   - Anthropic Adapter
   - LMStudio Adapter
   - Adapter Registry

2. **Services**:
   - Router Service
   - Classifier Service
   - Config Manager
   - Cache Service

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Prompt routes
   - Models routes
   - Health routes
   - Admin routes
   - Dashboard routes

4. **Validation**:
   - Request/response schema validation
   - Runtime type checking
   - Contract tests for external APIs
   - Model configuration validation

## Current Status

- Limited test coverage for model adapters and router service
- No integration tests for the complete request flow
- No performance or load testing
- No validation for API responses against schemas
- No mocking framework for external API calls

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Unit Testing

- [ ] Enhance model adapter tests with mocked API responses
- [ ] Add tests for router service with mocked model adapters
- [ ] Add tests for classifier service with various prompt types
- [ ] Add tests for config manager with mocked database
- [ ] Ensure at least 80% code coverage

### 2. Integration Testing

- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for the complete request flow
- [ ] Test different prompt types and model selections
- [ ] Test error scenarios and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Test caching and performance optimizations
- [ ] Set up test containers for database and Redis dependencies

### 3. Performance Testing

- [ ] Create benchmarks for key API endpoints
- [ ] Test throughput and latency under various loads
- [ ] Identify and address performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Test scaling behavior with multiple concurrent requests
- [ ] Establish performance baselines and regression tests

### 4. Validation Framework

- [ ] Add schema validation for all API requests and responses
- [ ] Implement runtime type checking for critical components
- [ ] Add contract tests for external API dependencies
- [ ] Create data validation for model configurations
- [ ] Implement automated validation in CI/CD pipeline

## Progress Updates

### 2025-04-23 - Initial Implementation

1. **Unit Testing Enhancements**:
   - Created enhanced test suite for OpenAI adapter (`openai-adapter.enhanced.test.ts`) with comprehensive tests for:
     - Error handling and retries
     - Circuit breaker functionality
     - Streaming capabilities
     - Error classification
   - Created enhanced test suite for Classifier service (`classifier.enhanced.test.ts`) with tests for:
     - Various prompt types (code, creative, analytical, factual, mathematical, conversational)
     - Complexity determination
     - Feature detection
     - Token estimation
     - Language and domain detection
   - Created enhanced test suite for Config Manager (`config-manager.enhanced.test.ts`) with tests for:
     - API key management with encryption
     - Model configuration management
     - Event listeners
     - Performance and edge cases

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Created integration test for the complete request flow (`request-flow.test.ts`) that tests:
     - Prompt routing to appropriate models
     - Model selection based on prompt classification
     - Fallback mechanisms when primary models are unavailable
     - Caching of responses
     - Error handling
     - Performance optimization settings

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Created benchmark test suite (`benchmark.ts`) that:
     - Tests throughput and latency for key API endpoints
     - Simulates various load conditions with different connection counts
     - Generates performance reports with metrics and charts
     - Establishes baselines for regression testing

4. **Validation Framework**:
   - Created schema validation for API requests and responses (`validation.ts`) using Zod:
     - Prompt request/response validation
     - Model configuration validation
     - API key validation
     - Integration with Fastify schema validation

5. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Created helper for building test instances (`app-builder.ts`)
   - Set up mocking for external dependencies

6. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Added GitHub Actions workflow for running tests (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
   - Set up code coverage reporting with Codecov
   - Configured test result reporting

7. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive testing documentation (`docs/testing-validation-report.md`)
   - Added examples of how to run tests
   - Documented validation schemas and test coverage
