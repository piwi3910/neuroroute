# Task Log: SECURITY_001 - API Key Exposure Remediation

**Goal:** Clean Git history to remove exposed API keys and implement secure API key management.

## Initial Status Check
- Repository is on `main` branch
- .env file contains actual API keys for OpenAI and Anthropic
- .env is already in .gitignore
- .env.example exists with proper placeholder structure
- API keys were exposed in Git history in commits:
  - b9f2ee4 "Initial commit: NeuroRoute MVP implementation"
  - 2123e2c "Set up necessary directories and files for NeuroRoute project"

## Actions Taken
1. Created a pattern file with the exposed API keys
2. Used git-filter-repo to clean the Git history:
   ```
   git-filter-repo --replace-text api_keys_pattern.txt --force
   ```
3. The operation was successful, but removed the 'origin' remote as expected
4. Added documentation about secure API key management to README.md
5. Re-added the origin remote:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/piwi3910/neuroroute.git
   ```
6. Removed the temporary pattern file:
   ```
   rm api_keys_pattern.txt
