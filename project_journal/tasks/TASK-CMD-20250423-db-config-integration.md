# Task Log: Database Integration for API Keys and Model Configurations

**Goal:** Implement secure storage and retrieval of API keys and model configurations from the database instead of environment variables.

## Current Status
- API keys are loaded directly from environment variables in model adapters
- Model configurations are hardcoded in the router service
- Database schema includes `configs` and `model_configs` tables that are not being utilized
- ConfigManager service exists but is not used for API keys or model configurations

## Required Changes
1. Update the ConfigManager service to:
   - Add methods for securely storing and retrieving API keys
   - Add methods for storing and retrieving model configurations
   - Implement encryption for sensitive data like API keys

2. Update model adapters to load API keys from the database:
   - Modify constructors to use ConfigManager instead of environment variables
   - Implement fallback to environment variables if database keys are not available
   - Add error handling for missing API keys

3. Update router service to load model configurations from the database:
   - Replace hardcoded model information with data from the database
   - Implement caching to avoid frequent database queries
   - Add functionality to update model configurations at runtime

4. Create database initialization script:
   - Add script to initialize the database with default configurations
   - Include migration of existing API keys from environment variables to database
   - Ensure secure handling of API keys during migration

## Acceptance Criteria
- API keys are securely stored in the database and not exposed in code or logs
- Model configurations are loaded from the database and can be updated without code changes
- Fallback mechanisms exist for cases where database access fails
- Performance impact is minimal with proper caching
