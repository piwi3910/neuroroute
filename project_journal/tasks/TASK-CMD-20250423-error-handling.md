# Task Log: Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

**Goal:** Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms throughout the NeuroRoute API to ensure reliability and graceful degradation.

## Current Status
- Model adapters return simulated responses on API errors
- Router service has fallback model selection but doesn't handle all error scenarios
- Error handling is inconsistent across different components
- No comprehensive retry mechanisms for transient errors

## Required Changes
1. Implement comprehensive error handling in model adapters:
   - Add proper error classification (network, authentication, rate limiting, etc.)
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors with exponential backoff
   - Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
   - Improve error reporting with detailed context

2. Enhance router service fallback mechanisms:
   - Implement multi-level fallback strategy for model selection
   - Add support for degraded operation modes
   - Implement timeout handling for slow model responses
   - Add monitoring and alerting for repeated fallbacks

3. Create centralized error handling middleware:
   - Standardize error responses across the API
   - Add correlation IDs for error tracking
   - Implement structured logging for errors
   - Add telemetry for error rates and patterns

4. Implement graceful degradation strategies:
   - Define service level objectives (SLOs) for different components
   - Implement feature flags for disabling non-critical functionality
   - Add cache fallbacks for common requests
   - Create read-only mode for database issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- API remains operational even when some components fail
- Errors are properly classified, logged, and reported
- Transient errors are automatically retried with appropriate backoff
- Persistent errors trigger appropriate fallback mechanisms
- Error responses are consistent and informative
- Performance impact of error handling is minimal
