# Task: Implement Preprocessor Service

**Task ID:** TASK-API-20250423-142030  
**Status:** Completed
**Coordinator:** TASK-CMD-20250423-141900  
**Assigned To:** api-developer  

## Goal

Implement the preprocessor service as the first component of the new flow architecture. The preprocessor will handle initial prompt processing before it's passed to the classifier and router.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create a modular preprocessor service with a plugin architecture
2. Implement basic sanitization as the first preprocessor
3. Add placeholder implementations for prompt compression and prompt replacement
4. Ensure the preprocessor can be easily extended with new processors
5. Add appropriate interfaces, types, and documentation
6. Include unit tests for the preprocessor service

### Interfaces

```typescript
// Example interface for preprocessors
export interface Preprocessor {
  name: string;
  process(prompt: string, options?: PreprocessorOptions): Promise<string>;
  isEnabled(options?: PreprocessorOptions): boolean;
}

export interface PreprocessorOptions {
  [key: string]: any;
}

export interface PreprocessorRegistry {
  register(preprocessor: Preprocessor): void;
  getAll(): Preprocessor[];
  get(name: string): Preprocessor | undefined;
  process(prompt: string, options?: PreprocessorOptions): Promise<string>;
}
```

### Implementation Notes

1. The preprocessor service should be designed to be easily extensible
2. Each preprocessor should have a single responsibility
3. The registry should allow for dynamic enabling/disabling of preprocessors
4. The service should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
5. The service should include appropriate logging
6. The service should be thoroughly tested

## Implementation Summary

The preprocessor service has been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **Base Structure**:
   - Defined interfaces for preprocessor plugins, registry, and service
   - Implemented the preprocessor registry for managing preprocessors
   - Created the main entry point with a factory function

2. **Preprocessors**:
   - Implemented sanitization preprocessor with HTML tag removal, script tag removal, and optional URL/email/personal info removal
   - Added placeholder for compression preprocessor with basic functionality (newline removal, extra space removal, abbreviation)
   - Added placeholder for replacement preprocessor with pattern-based text replacement

3. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Added custom `PreprocessorError` class for specific error handling
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling in all preprocessors
   - Added detailed logging throughout the service

4. **Documentation**:
   - Added JSDoc comments to all functions and interfaces
   - Created a comprehensive README.md with usage examples and extension guidelines

5. **Testing**:
   - Implemented unit tests for the preprocessor registry
   - Added tests for individual preprocessors
   - Created tests for the full preprocessor pipeline

The preprocessor service is now ready for integration with the classifier and router components of the flow architecture.
