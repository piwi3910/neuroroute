# Task Log: Testing and Validation Framework

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive testing and validation framework for the NeuroRoute API to ensure reliability, correctness, and performance.

## Current Status
- Limited test coverage for model adapters and router service
- No integration tests for the complete request flow
- No performance or load testing
- No validation for API responses against schemas
- No mocking framework for external API calls

## Required Changes
1. Implement unit testing for all components:
   - Add tests for model adapters with mocked API responses
   - Add tests for router service with mocked model adapters
   - Add tests for classifier service with various prompt types
   - Add tests for config manager with mocked database
   - Ensure at least 80% code coverage

2. Implement integration testing:
   - Create end-to-end tests for the complete request flow
   - Test different prompt types and model selections
   - Test error scenarios and fallback mechanisms
   - Test caching and performance optimizations
   - Use test containers for database and Redis dependencies

3. Implement performance testing:
   - Create benchmarks for key API endpoints
   - Test throughput and latency under various loads
   - Identify and address performance bottlenecks
   - Test scaling behavior with multiple concurrent requests
   - Establish performance baselines and regression tests

4. Implement validation framework:
   - Add schema validation for all API requests and responses
   - Implement runtime type checking for critical components
   - Add contract tests for external API dependencies
   - Create data validation for model configurations
   - Implement automated validation in CI/CD pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria
- All components have comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests cover all critical paths
- Performance tests establish baselines and detect regressions
- Validation framework ensures correctness of data and API contracts
- CI/CD pipeline includes all tests and validations
- Test coverage is at least 80% for all components
