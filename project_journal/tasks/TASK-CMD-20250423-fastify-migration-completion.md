# Task Log: FastAPI to Fastify Migration Completion

**Goal:** Complete the migration from FastAPI to Fastify by implementing all missing functionality and ensuring the API is production-ready.

## Current Status
- Basic Fastify structure is in place
- Model adapters are implemented but not integrated with the router
- API keys are loaded from environment variables instead of the database
- Several components use simulated responses instead of real implementations
- Limited error handling and testing

## Subtasks

5. **Admin Interface for API Keys and Model Configurations** [TASK-CMD-20250423-admin-interface.md]
   - Status: ⏳ Pending
   - Priority: Low
   - Dependencies: Database Integration
   - Assigned To: Frontend Developer

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Core Functionality** (Estimated: 1 week)
   - Complete Router Integration with Model Adapters
   - Implement Database Integration for API Keys and Model Configurations
   - Basic error handling and testing

2. **Phase 2: Reliability and Testing** (Estimated: 1 week)
   - Enhance Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms
   - Implement comprehensive Testing and Validation Framework
   - Performance testing and optimization

3. **Phase 3: Admin and Monitoring** (Estimated: 1 week)
   - Implement Admin Interface for API Keys and Model Configurations
   - Add monitoring and alerting
   - Documentation and deployment

## Acceptance Criteria
- All subtasks are completed and meet their respective acceptance criteria
- API is fully functional with real model integrations
- API keys and model configurations are securely stored in the database
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms are in place
- Test coverage is at least 80% for all components
- Admin interface provides complete management of API keys and model configurations
