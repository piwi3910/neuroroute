**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Successfully staged, committed (f2d331d), and pushed the Flow Architecture implementation changes to the `feature/flow` branch. This includes updates to preprocessor, classifier, router services, prompt route, integration tests, documentation, and project journal files.
**References:** [Branch: feature/flow], [Commit: f2d331d]
### 2025-04-23 18:57 - Git Commit Task Completed

- **Action:** The Git Manager task has been successfully completed.
- **Result:** All changes related to the Flow Architecture implementation have been committed and pushed to the `origin/feature/flow` branch.
- **Commit:** `f2d331d`
- **Next Step:** The overall task of implementing the Flow Architecture is complete.
### 2025-04-24 07:28 - Build Fix Task Completed

- **Action:** The Build Fix task (`TASK-API-20250424-072600`) has been successfully completed.
- **Result:** The TypeScript errors in the preprocessor service were resolved.
- **Changes:** 
  - Corrected the `PreprocessorRegistry` interface in `neuroroute-api/src/services/preprocessor/interfaces.ts` to include the `process` method signature.
- **Next Step:** Re-run the build command to confirm the fix.
### 2025-04-24 07:31 - ESM Fix Task Completed

- **Action:** The ESM Fix task (`TASK-API-20250424-073000`) has been successfully completed.
- **Result:** The `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error during `npm run dev` was resolved.
- **Changes:** 
  - Corrected the import statement for the config module in `neuroroute-api/src/app.ts` to use the `.js` extension (`./config.js`).
- **Next Step:** Re-run `npm run dev` to start the server and proceed with `curl` tests.
### 2025-04-24 08:02 - Server Port Debug Findings

- **Action:** Delegated task (`TASK-API-20250424-075700`) to debug the server port binding.
- **Result:** The API Developer found that an operating system level `PORT=8000` environment variable was overriding the `.env` file settings.
- **Required User Action:**
    1.  Find and remove or change the `PORT` environment variable in your shell configuration files (e.g., `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`).
    2.  Restart your terminal session.
    3.  Navigate back to the `neuroroute-api` directory (`cd neuroroute-api`).
    4.  Run `npm run dev` again.
- **Next Step:** User to confirm completion of manual steps and terminal restart. Then, re-test API on port 3000.
