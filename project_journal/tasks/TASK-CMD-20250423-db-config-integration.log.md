# Task Log: TASK-CMD-20250423-db-config-integration

**Goal:** Implement secure storage and retrieval of API keys and model configurations from the database instead of environment variables.

**DB Type:** PostgreSQL
**Method:** Prisma ORM

## Initial Analysis

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified the following components that need to be modified:

1. **ConfigManager Service**: Currently handles general configuration but doesn't specifically manage API keys or model configurations.
2. **Model Adapters**: Currently load API keys directly from environment variables.
3. **Router Service**: Currently uses hardcoded model configurations.
4. **Database Schema**: Includes `configs` and `model_configs` tables that are not being utilized.

## Schema Design Decisions

The existing schema already includes the necessary tables:

- `configs`: For storing general configuration including API keys
- `model_configs`: For storing model-specific configurations

For API keys, I'll use the `configs` table with a specific key naming convention (e.g., `api_key.openai`) and implement encryption for these values.

## Implementation Plan

1. Update ConfigManager service to:
   - Add methods for securely storing and retrieving API keys
   - Add methods for storing and retrieving model configurations
   - Implement encryption for sensitive data

2. Update model adapters to:
   - Use ConfigManager instead of environment variables
   - Implement fallback to environment variables
   - Add error handling for missing API keys

3. Update router service to:
   - Load model configurations from the database
   - Implement caching to avoid frequent database queries
   - Add functionality to update model configurations at runtime

4. Create database initialization script to:
   - Migrate existing API keys from environment variables to database
   - Set up default model configurations

## Implementation Details

### 1. ConfigManager Service Updates

The ConfigManager service has been updated to:
- Add encryption/decryption methods for sensitive data
- Add methods for storing and retrieving API keys
- Add methods for storing and retrieving model configurations
- Implement caching to avoid frequent database queries

Key methods added:
- `getApiKey(provider)`: Get API key for a provider with fallback to environment variables
- `setApiKey(provider, apiKey)`: Securely store API key in the database
- `getAllApiKeys()`: Get all API keys from the database
- `getModelConfig(modelId)`: Get model configuration from the database
- `setModelConfig(modelConfig)`: Store model configuration in the database
- `getAllModelConfigs()`: Get all model configurations from the database

### 2. Model Adapter Updates

All model adapters have been updated to:
- Load API keys from the ConfigManager instead of environment variables
- Implement fallback to environment variables if database keys are not available
- Add error handling for missing API keys

Updated adapters:
- OpenAI adapter
- Anthropic adapter
- LMStudio adapter

### 3. Router Service Updates

The router service has been updated to:
- Load model configurations from the database instead of hardcoded values
- Implement caching to avoid frequent database queries
- Add functionality to update model configurations at runtime
- Add periodic reload of model configurations

### 4. Database Initialization Script

Created a script to:
- Migrate existing API keys from environment variables to the database
- Set up default model configurations for all supported models
- Implement encryption for sensitive data like API keys

### 5. Fastify Integration

Added a Fastify plugin to:
- Register the ConfigManager service with Fastify
- Make it available to all routes and other plugins
- Ensure proper initialization and cleanup

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- API keys are securely stored in the database
- Model configurations are loaded from the database
- Fallback mechanisms work when database access fails
- Performance impact is minimal with proper caching

## Status

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Implemented secure storage and retrieval of API keys and model configurations from the database with fallback to environment variables. Updated all model adapters and the router service to use the new ConfigManager. Created a database initialization script to migrate existing API keys and set up default model configurations.
