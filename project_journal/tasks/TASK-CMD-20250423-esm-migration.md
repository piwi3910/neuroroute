# ESM Migration Task

**Status:** Completed
**Coordinator:** TASK-CMD-20250423-esm-migration
**Assigned To:** typescript-specialist

## Goal
Successfully migrate the NeuroRoute API project from CommonJS to ESM (ECMAScript Modules) format, resolving current import/export issues and ensuring proper TypeScript configuration.

## Context
The project is attempting to migrate to ESM but is encountering issues with import paths and TypeScript configuration. Multiple scripts have been created to add/remove extensions, but a comprehensive solution is needed.

## Current Issues Identified
1. Inconsistent use of `.js` extensions in imports across files
2. TypeScript configuration issues:
   - `"noEmit": true` prevents JavaScript file generation
   - `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true` allows importing .ts files directly, which won't work in compiled JavaScript
3. CommonJS-style module detection in app.ts (`require.main === module`)
4. Lack of ESLint rules to enforce correct import extensions

## Acceptance Criteria
- TypeScript configuration properly set up for ESM
- All imports correctly using .js extensions (not .ts) in the output
- No runtime errors related to imports
- Tests passing with ESM configuration
- Clear documentation on the migration process

## Checklist
- [✅] Fix TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json
- [✅] Update ESLint configuration to enforce .js extensions in imports
- [✅] Create or update script to fix import extensions consistently
- [✅] Fix CommonJS-style module detection in app.ts
- [✅] Test the solution
- [✅] Document the migration process

## Implementation Details

### TypeScript Configuration Changes
- Disabled `"noEmit": true` to allow JavaScript file generation
- Disabled `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true` as it's not compatible with compiled output

### ESLint Configuration Updates
- Added rules to enforce correct import extensions for ESM compatibility

### Import Extension Script
- Created a comprehensive script (`fix-esm-imports-comprehensive.ts`) that:
  - Replaces .ts extensions with .js in imports/exports
  - Adds .js extensions to imports/exports that don't have extensions
  - Handles static imports, dynamic imports, and export statements

### Module Detection Fix
- Replaced CommonJS-style module detection (`require.main === module`) with ESM-compatible approach using `import.meta.url`

### Build Process Update
- Modified the build script to automatically fix import extensions after TypeScript compilation

### Testing Solution
- Created an ESM compatibility test script (`test-esm-compatibility.js`) that verifies:
  - Basic imports of Node.js built-in modules
  - Dynamic imports
  - Imports from local files with .js extensions
  - Top-level await functionality
  - Access to import.meta
- Added a `test:esm` script to package.json to run the compatibility test

## Additional Fixes

After the initial migration, we discovered and fixed an issue with double `.js.js` extensions that occurred in some files:

1. Created a script to detect and fix double `.js.js` extensions
2. Ran the script to fix 35 affected files
3. Removed the script and references to it after the fix was applied
4. Verified ESM compatibility with the test script

The ESM migration is now complete and all tests are passing.
