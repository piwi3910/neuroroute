# Task: Migrate from FastAPI to Fastify

**Status:** In Progress  
**Coordinator:** Roo Commander  
**Assigned To:** Technical Architect (pending)  
**Created:** 2025-04-22  

## Goal

Analyze the current NeuroRoute application and create a plan to migrate from FastAPI to Fastify while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Current Application Analysis

### Overview

NeuroRoute is an intelligent LLM routing layer that forwards prompts to the best-suited LLM backend based on intent, complexity, and required features. The application is built with FastAPI and provides a RESTful API for routing prompts to different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and local LM Studio).

### Core Components

1. **API Layer (FastAPI)**
   - Main entry point (`main.py`) with FastAPI application setup
   - API endpoints for prompt routing, model information, health checks, and API key management
   - Error handling middleware and request/response processing

2. **Router System**
   - Core routing logic (`router.py`) that selects the appropriate model for a given prompt
   - Model health checking and fallback mechanisms
   - Metrics tracking for model usage

3. **Classifier**
   - Prompt analysis system (`classifier.py`) that determines the best model based on prompt content
   - Feature extraction and rule-based classification
   - Capability matching and metadata-based adjustments

4. **Model Adapters**
   - Base adapter interface (`models/base_adapter.py`) defining common functionality
   - Provider-specific adapters:
     - OpenAI adapter (`models/openai_adapter.py`)
     - Anthropic adapter (`models/anthropic_adapter.py`)
     - Local LM Studio adapter (`models/local_lmstudio_adapter.py`)

5. **Caching System**
   - Redis-based caching (`cache.py`) for storing and retrieving responses
   - Key generation based on prompt and metadata
   - Cache statistics and management

6. **Database Layer**
   - SQLite database for storing API keys and settings
   - ORM models using SQLAlchemy
   - CRUD operations for API key management

7. **Configuration System**
   - Settings management (`config.py`) using Pydantic models
   - Environment variable loading
   - Model registry and capability definitions

### Key Features

1. **Smart Routing**: Routes prompts to the most appropriate LLM backend
2. **Multiple LLM Backends**: Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and local LM Studio
3. **Redis Caching**: Optional caching of responses for improved performance
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging of prompts, responses, and metrics
5. **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new models and classification strategies
6. **API Key Management**: Secure storage of API keys in a local database
7. **Health Monitoring**: Regular health checks of model availability
8. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Automatic fallback to alternative models when primary model fails

### API Endpoints

1. **Prompt Routing**
   - `POST /prompt`: Main endpoint for routing prompts
   - `POST /test-model/{model_key}`: Test a specific model directly

2. **Model Information**
   - `GET /models`: List available models and their capabilities
   - `GET /models/capabilities`: Get detailed information about model capabilities
   - `GET /models/{model_key}/health`: Get health status for a specific model

3. **API Key Management**
   - `GET /api-keys/`: List all API keys
   - `POST /api-keys/`: Create or update an API key
   - `GET /api-keys/{provider}`: Get API key for a specific provider
   - `PUT /api-keys/{provider}`: Update API key for a specific provider
   - `DELETE /api-keys/{provider}`: Delete API key for a specific provider

4. **System Management**
   - `GET /health`: Get system health status
   - `POST /admin/cache/clear`: Clear the response cache

### Dependencies

1. **FastAPI**: Web framework for building APIs
2. **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI applications
3. **Redis**: For response caching
4. **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database operations
5. **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
6. **OpenAI SDK**: For interacting with OpenAI API
7. **Anthropic SDK**: For interacting with Anthropic API
8. **httpx**: HTTP client for making requests to LM Studio

## Next Steps

1. Delegate to Technical Architect to discuss the tech stack for the Fastify migration
2. Create a detailed migration plan
3. Implement the migration in phases
4. Test the new implementation
5. Deploy the migrated application

## Acceptance Criteria

- All existing functionality is maintained in the Fastify implementation
- API endpoints remain compatible with the current implementation
- Performance is equal to or better than the current implementation
- Code is well-structured and follows best practices
- Tests pass for all components

## Technical Architect Assessment

The Technical Architect has provided a comprehensive assessment of the migration from FastAPI to Fastify. Key points:

### Technical Feasibility

The migration is **technically feasible** with moderate effort. The core functionality of both frameworks is compatible, and NeuroRoute's modular design with clear separation of concerns makes it well-suited for migration.

### FastAPI vs Fastify Comparison

| Aspect | FastAPI | Fastify | Impact on NeuroRoute |
|--------|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Performance** | Good performance with Starlette/Uvicorn | Superior performance (2-3x faster in benchmarks) | Potential for reduced latency in prompt routing, especially under high load |
| **Schema Validation** | Pydantic (Python-based) | JSON Schema (native) | Migration effort required, but potential performance gain |
| **Documentation** | OpenAPI/Swagger integration | OpenAPI/Swagger support via plugins | Equivalent capability |
| **Middleware** | ASGI middleware | Hooks and plugins | Different implementation pattern, but equivalent functionality |
| **Async Support** | Native async/await | Native async/await | Equivalent capability |
| **Error Handling** | Exception handlers | Error handlers | Similar concepts, different implementation |
| **Type Safety** | Strong with Python type hints | Good with TypeScript definitions | Depends on implementation language choice |
| **Ecosystem** | Python ecosystem | Node.js ecosystem | Major shift in dependencies and tooling |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Moderate | Team familiarity with JavaScript/Node.js will be a factor |

### Recommended Migration Approach

The architect recommends an **incremental migration approach** with the following phases:

1. **Phase 1: Preparation and Proof of Concept**
   - Create a parallel Fastify implementation of a subset of endpoints
   - Establish core architecture patterns
   - Develop a compatibility layer for shared business logic
   - Set up testing infrastructure

2. **Phase 2: Core Components Migration**
   - Migrate the main prompt routing endpoint
   - Implement schema validation using Fastify's JSON Schema
   - Create Fastify plugins for core functionality
   - Implement equivalent middleware functionality

3. **Phase 3: Complete Migration and Optimization**
   - Migrate remaining endpoints and functionality
   - Optimize for Fastify-specific performance improvements
   - Enhance error handling and logging
   - Complete test coverage and documentation

### Key Architectural Considerations

1. **Plugin Architecture**: Restructure the application to leverage Fastify's plugin system
2. **Schema Validation**: Replace Pydantic models with JSON Schema validation
3. **Lifecycle Management**: Replace FastAPI's `lifespan` with Fastify's lifecycle hooks
4. **Error Handling**: Implement custom error handlers for consistent responses
5. **Request ID Tracking**: Implement using Fastify hooks

### Potential Challenges

1. **Language Transition**: Moving from Python to JavaScript/TypeScript
2. **Dependency Management**: Finding equivalent Node.js libraries
3. **Async Pattern Differences**: Adapting to JavaScript's async implementation
4. **Testing Framework**: Rebuilding the test suite
5. **Schema Validation Complexity**: Translating Pydantic to JSON Schema
6. **Deployment Changes**: Adapting deployment pipelines for Node.js

### Suggested Tech Stack

- **Web Framework**: Fastify (latest version)
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Runtime**: Node.js (LTS version)
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - Fastify's built-in JSON Schema validation with Ajv
  - `@fastify/postgres` or `better-sqlite3` for database access
  - `@fastify/redis` for Redis integration
  - `undici` or `@fastify/http-client` for HTTP requests
  - `pino` for logging
  - `tap` or `jest` for testing
  - `@fastify/swagger` for documentation

## Next Steps

1. Discuss the Technical Architect's assessment with the team
2. Make a decision on whether to proceed with the migration
3. If proceeding, create a detailed migration plan
4. Set up a proof-of-concept implementation
5. Evaluate the results before committing to full migration
