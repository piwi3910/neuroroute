# Task: Fix Preprocessor Build Errors

**Task ID:** TASK-API-20250424-072600  
**Status:** Complete
**Status:** Pending  
**Coordinator:** TASK-CMD-20250423-141900  
**Assigned To:** api-developer  

## Goal

Resolve the TypeScript build errors related to the `process` method in the preprocessor service.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Fix the TypeScript errors reported during the `npm run build` command.
2. Ensure the `process` method is correctly defined and accessed within the `PreprocessorRegistry` and its usage points.
3. Verify the build completes successfully after the fixes.

## Context Files

- Build Error Output:
  ```
  src/services/preprocessor/index.ts:83:23 - error TS2339: Property 'process' does not exist on type 'PreprocessorRegistry'.

  83       return registry.process(prompt, options);
                           ~~~~~~~

  src/services/preprocessor/registry.ts:68:11 - error TS2353: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'process' does not exist in type 'PreprocessorRegistry'.

  68     async process(prompt: string, options?: PreprocessorOptions): Promise<string> {
               ~~~~~~~
  ```
- `neuroroute-api/src/services/preprocessor/index.ts`
- `neuroroute-api/src/services/preprocessor/registry.ts`
- `neuroroute-api/src/services/preprocessor/interfaces.ts` (Potentially relevant for type definitions)

## Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Analyze the `PreprocessorRegistry` class and related interfaces in `registry.ts` and `interfaces.ts`.
- [‚è≥] Analyze the `PreprocessorRegistry` class and related interfaces in `registry.ts` and `interfaces.ts`.
- [‚úÖ] Identify the correct way to define or access the processing logic (is `process` the intended method name? Is it part of the class or an instance?). -> Missing in interface.
- [‚è≥] Identify the correct way to define or access the processing logic (is `process` the intended method name? Is it part of the class or an instance?).
- [‚úÖ] Modify `registry.ts` to correctly define the `process` method or use the intended method. -> No change needed in registry.ts.
- [‚è≥] Modify `registry.ts` to correctly define the `process` method or use the intended method.
- [‚úÖ] Modify `index.ts` (line 83) to correctly call the processing method on the `registry` instance. -> No change needed in index.ts, call was correct.
- [‚è≥] Modify `index.ts` (line 83) to correctly call the processing method on the `registry` instance.
- [‚úÖ] Run `npm run build` in the `neuroroute-api` directory to confirm the errors are resolved.
- [‚è≥] Run `npm run build` in the `neuroroute-api` directory to confirm the errors are resolved.

üì£ Report back once the build errors are fixed and `npm run build` runs successfully.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Added the missing `process` method signature to the `PreprocessorRegistry` interface in `neuroroute-api/src/services/preprocessor/interfaces.ts`. This resolved the TypeScript build errors reported in TASK-CMD-20250423-141900. The `npm run build` command now completes successfully.
