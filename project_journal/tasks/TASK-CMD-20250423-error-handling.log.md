# Task Log: TASK-CMD-20250423-error-handling

**Goal:** Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms throughout the NeuroRoute API to ensure reliability and graceful degradation.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Model Adapters

- Added proper error classification in `error-handler.ts`:
  - Created comprehensive error types for different scenarios (network, authentication, rate limiting, etc.)
  - Implemented `classifyExternalError` function to categorize errors from external APIs
  - Added detailed context to error objects for better debugging

- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff in model adapters:
  - Added circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
  - Improved error reporting with detailed context

### 2. Enhanced Router Service Fallback Mechanisms

- Implemented multi-level fallback strategy:
  - Added `executeFallbackStrategy` method to try multiple fallback models in priority order
  - Implemented `getFallbackModelsInOrder` to prioritize fallbacks based on provider, capabilities, and quality
  - Added monitoring and alerting for repeated fallbacks

- Added support for degraded operation modes:
  - Implemented `createDegradedResponse` method to provide graceful responses when all models fail
  - Added configuration options for degraded mode

- Implemented timeout handling for slow model responses:
  - Enhanced `sendToModel` method with timeout support
  - Added proper error handling for timeouts

### 3. Centralized Error Handling

- Enhanced error handling middleware:
  - Standardized error responses across the API
  - Added correlation IDs for error tracking
  - Implemented structured logging for errors
  - Added telemetry for error rates and patterns

### 4. Graceful Degradation Strategies

- Implemented feature flags for disabling non-critical functionality
- Added cache fallbacks for common requests
- Created read-only mode for database issues

## Technical Details

### Error Classification

The system now classifies errors into the following categories:
- Network errors (connectivity issues, timeouts)
- Authentication errors (invalid API keys, permissions)
- Rate limiting errors (too many requests)
- Quota exceeded errors (billing limits)
- Content filtering errors (policy violations)
- Context length errors (input too long)
- Invalid request errors (malformed inputs)
- Internal errors (unexpected issues)

### Fallback Strategy

The multi-level fallback strategy follows this priority order:
1. Same provider models (e.g., fallback to another OpenAI model)
2. Models with similar capabilities (e.g., code generation, summarization)
3. Models that match the classification requirements
4. Any available model sorted by quality

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Added tracking of fallback attempts per model
- Implemented alerts when fallbacks occur too frequently
- Added detailed logging for all error scenarios

## Testing

The error handling and fallback mechanisms have been tested with various scenarios:
- Network failures
- API key issues
- Rate limiting
- Timeout scenarios
- Multiple fallback levels

## Future Improvements

- Add more sophisticated circuit breaker patterns
- Implement adaptive timeout strategies based on historical performance
- Enhance the degraded mode responses with cached similar responses
- Add more granular feature flags for partial degradation

## Conclusion

The implemented error handling and fallback mechanisms significantly improve the reliability and resilience of the NeuroRoute API. The system can now gracefully handle various failure scenarios and provide meaningful responses even when components fail.
