# Task: Enhance Classifier Service

**Task ID:** TASK-API-20250423-142100  
**Status:** In Progress
**Coordinator:** TASK-CMD-20250423-141900  
**Assigned To:** api-developer  

## Goal

Enhance the existing classifier service to support a plugin architecture, allowing for different classifier implementations while maintaining the current rules-based classifier as the default.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Refactor the classifier service to support pluggable classifier implementations
2. Extract the current rules-based logic into a separate implementation
3. Create interfaces for future ML-based classifiers
4. Implement a classifier registry for managing different classifier implementations
5. Ensure backward compatibility with existing code
6. Add appropriate unit tests for the enhanced classifier service
7. Update documentation with examples of how to add new classifiers

## Technical Details

### Current Structure

The current classifier service is implemented in `src/services/classifier.ts` and provides functionality to classify prompts based on rules. It needs to be refactored to support different classifier implementations.

### Proposed Structure

```
src/services/classifier/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                 # Main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interfaces.ts            # Type definitions and interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ registry.ts              # Classifier registry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ classifiers/             # Individual classifier implementations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rules-based.ts       # Current rules-based classifier
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ml-based.ts          # Placeholder for future ML-based classifier
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                # Documentation
```

### Interfaces

```typescript
// Example interface for classifiers
export interface Classifier {
  name: string;
  classify(prompt: string, options?: ClassifierOptions): Promise<ClassificationResult>;
  isEnabled(options?: ClassifierOptions): boolean;
}

export interface ClassifierOptions {
  [key: string]: any;
}

export interface ClassificationResult {
  type: string;
  confidence: number;
  tags: string[];
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

export interface ClassifierRegistry {
  register(classifier: Classifier): void;
  getAll(): Classifier[];
  get(name: string): Classifier | undefined;
  getDefault(): Classifier;
  setDefault(name: string): void;
  classify(prompt: string, options?: ClassifierOptions): Promise<ClassificationResult>;
}
```

### Implementation Notes

1. The enhanced classifier service should maintain backward compatibility
2. The current rules-based classifier should be extracted but remain the default
3. The registry should allow for dynamic registration of new classifiers
4. The service should include appropriate error handling and logging
5. The interfaces should be designed to accommodate future ML-based classifiers

üì£ Report back when the interfaces and registry are implemented.
üì£ Report back when the rules-based classifier is extracted and working.
üì£ Report back when all enhancements and tests are implemented.

## Progress Updates

### 2025-04-23 15:30 - Interfaces and Registry Implementation

- ‚úÖ Created the classifier registry with the following functionality:
  - Registration of classifiers
  - Unregistration of classifiers
  - Retrieval of all classifiers
  - Retrieval of enabled classifiers
  - Retrieval of specific classifiers by name

- ‚úÖ Created a placeholder for ML-based classifier implementation
  - Implemented the Classifier interface
  - Added proper error handling and logging
  - Set up as disabled by default (for future implementation)

- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive documentation
  - Created README.md with usage examples
  - Added JSDoc comments to all functions and interfaces
  - Included examples of how to add new classifiers

Next steps:
1. Extract the current rules-based classifier into a separate implementation
2. Update the main classifier service to use the registry

### 2025-04-23 18:20 - Rules-Based Classifier Extraction and Service Update

- ‚úÖ Extracted the rules-based classifier into a separate implementation
  - Moved the existing classification logic to `src/services/classifier/classifiers/rules-based.ts`
  - Implemented the Classifier interface
  - Added comprehensive error handling
  - Improved code organization with helper functions for different aspects of classification

- ‚úÖ Updated the main classifier service to use the registry
  - Modified `src/services/classifier/index.ts` to create and use the registry
  - Registered both rules-based and ML-based classifiers
  - Set the rules-based classifier as the default
  - Ensured backward compatibility with existing code

- ‚úÖ Implemented unit tests for all components
  - Created tests for the classifier registry
  - Created tests for the rules-based classifier
  - Created tests for the main classifier service
  - Ensured all tests pass with good coverage

The enhanced classifier service now supports a plugin architecture, allowing for different classifier implementations while maintaining the current rules-based classifier as the default. The code is well-structured, thoroughly tested, and maintains backward compatibility.

### 2025-04-23 18:30 - Final Implementation Summary

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Outcome:** Success

**Summary:**
Successfully enhanced the classifier service to support a plugin architecture with the following key features:

1. **Registry Pattern**: Implemented a classifier registry that manages different classifier implementations

- `src/services/classifier/interfaces.ts` - Type definitions and interfaces
- `src/services/classifier/registry.ts` - Classifier registry implementation
- `src/services/classifier/classifiers/rules-based.ts` - Rules-based classifier implementation
