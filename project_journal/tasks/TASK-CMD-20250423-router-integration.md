# Task Log: Router Integration with Model Adapters

**Goal:** Implement the integration between the router service and model adapters to use real API calls instead of simulated responses.

## Current Status
- ✅ Router service (`router.ts`) now uses real model adapters in the `sendToModel` method
- ✅ Model adapter registry implemented to instantiate the appropriate adapter based on model ID
- ✅ Model availability checking updated to use the adapter's `isAvailable` method
- ✅ Unit tests added for the adapter registry and router integration

## Required Changes
1. Update the `sendToModel` method in `router.ts` to:
   - Import and instantiate the appropriate model adapter based on the model ID
   - Call the adapter's `generateCompletion` method with the prompt and options
   - Return the actual response from the model adapter
   - Maintain error handling, logging, and metrics collection

2. Implement model adapter factory/registry:
   - Create a registry of available model adapters
   - Implement a factory function to create the appropriate adapter based on model ID
   - Cache adapters to avoid recreating them for each request

3. Update model availability checking:
   - Modify `checkModelAvailability` to actually check if the model adapters are available
   - Use the adapter's `isAvailable` method to determine availability

## Acceptance Criteria
- Router service successfully calls the appropriate model adapter based on model ID
- Real responses from the models are returned to the client
- Error handling, logging, and metrics collection are maintained
- Performance impact is minimal
